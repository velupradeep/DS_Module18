# Ex26 Prim’s Algorithm
## DATE: 01/05/2025
## AIM:
To write a C program to implement Prim's Algorithm for finding Total Cost of tree.

## Algorithm
1.Initialize constants and global variables:

Define infinity as 9999 and MAX as 20.
Declare matrices G[MAX][MAX], spanning[MAX][MAX], and an integer n.
2.Define the function prims() to compute the minimum spanning tree.

3.In the main function:

Declare variables i, j, and total_cost as integers.
Read the number of vertices n using scanf.
For each vertex i from 0 to n-1:
For each vertex j from 0 to n-1:
Read the edge weights into the adjacency matrix G[i][j] using scanf.
Call the prims() function and store the result in total_cost.
For each vertex i from 0 to n-1:
For each vertex j from 0 to n-1:
Print the spanning tree matrix spanning[i][j].
Print a newline.
Print the total cost of the spanning tree.
Return 0 to indicate successful completion.
4.In the prims() function:

Declare local variables cost[MAX][MAX], u, v, min_distance, distance[MAX], from[MAX], visited[MAX], no_of_edges, i, min_cost, and j.
Create the cost[][] matrix and initialize the spanning[][] matrix:
For each vertex i from 0 to n-1:
For each vertex j from 0 to n-1:
If G[i][j] is 0, set cost[i][j] to infinity; otherwise, set cost[i][j] to G[i][j] and initialize spanning[i][j] to 0.
Initialize the visited[], distance[], and from[] arrays:
Set distance[0] to 0 and visited[0] to 1.
For each vertex i from 1 to n-1:
Set distance[i] to cost[0][i] and from[i] to 0, and set visited[i] to 0.
Initialize min_cost to 0 and no_of_edges to n-1.
While no_of_edges is greater than 0:
Find the vertex v with the minimum distance from the tree:
Set min_distance to infinity.
For each vertex i from 1 to n-1:
If visited[i] is 0 and distance[i] is less than min_distance, update v and min_distance.
Set u to from[v].
Insert the edge in the spanning tree by updating spanning[u][v] and spanning[v][u] with distance[v].
Decrement no_of_edges and set visited[v] to 1.
Update the distance[] array:
For each vertex i from 1 to n-1:
If visited[i] is 0 and cost[i][v] is less than distance[i], update distance[i] and from[i].
Add cost[u][v] to min_cost.
Return min_cost as the total cost of the minimum spanning tree.
